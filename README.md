### Hi there 👋

I'm Rahma, I study computer science at KNUST.

I am fascinated by innovations in AI and I'm primarily interested in full-stack development, Artificial Intelligence, and everything in between.

Outside of coding, I enjoy consuming business and entrepreneurship-related content as I aspire to become a serial entrepreneur. I also love exploring and discovering new things, particularly in science and technology, as well as in social and economic development. I'm a multi-faceted individual 😐. 
Additionally, I love writing and am looking to start a blog soon.
