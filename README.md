### Hello, World!👋

I'm Rahma, a second year Computer Science student at KNUST. <br>

I'm fascinated by innovations in AI and I'm primarily interested in full-stack development, Machine Learning, and everything in between.

Outside of coding, I love exploring and discovering new things, particularly in science and technology, as well as in social and economic development. I'm a multi-faceted individual 😐. <br>
